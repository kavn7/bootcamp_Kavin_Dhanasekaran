# Summary: How Social Media Influences Carvana Stock Performance

This project explores the impact of social media chatter on Carvana's stock price movements over the last two years. By analyzing patterns in posts, user engagement, and news sentiment alongside stock price data, we looked for signals that could help predict price trends.

Key Findings:
- Increased social media activity often coincides with heightened stock volatility.
- Certain features like momentum in posts and engagement spikes serve as early indicators.
- Predictive models showed moderate success in forecasting short-term price changes.

Benefits:
- Investors can use social media trends as an additional tool for market analysis.
- The integration of financial and social data provides unique insights not visible from price data alone.

Next Steps:
- Include real-time social media sentiment analysis.
- Expand to other automotive stocks for comparative insights.
- Develop user-friendly dashboards for monitoring social trends with stock alerts.

This study demonstrates the promising role of social data in financial decision-making and paves the way for more advanced predictive tools.
